Check all bits are Set or not.

PROBLEM: I/P- N=7         (Binary representation of 7 is 111, all bits are set so output is 1)
         O/P- 1
         
         I/P- N=8         (Binary representation of 8 is 100, all bits are not set so output is 0)
         O/P- 0
         
SOLUTION:

    int isBitSet(int N){
        return !(N & N+1);
    }
