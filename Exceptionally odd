Here all the elements are occured even times except one number it occure odd times. So we need to find that odd time occure number.

PROBLEM: I/P- N=9
              arr[]={1,3,2,4,3,4,2,1,2}
              
         O/P- 4
         
         
SOLUTION:

  int getOddOccurrence(int arr[], int n) {
        int a = arr[0];
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            a=a^arr[i];
        }
        return a;
    }
