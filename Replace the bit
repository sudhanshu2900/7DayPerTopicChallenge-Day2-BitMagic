PROBLEM: I/P- n=13    
              k=2
         O/P- 9
         
         Explain: Binary represenation of 13 is 1101 and we want to convert 2nd bit (from left side) 1 to 0. Then it form 1001 i.e 9
         
SOLUTION:

    int replaceBit (int n, int k)
    {
        int N=(log2(n))+1;              //It is used to count the digits in binary from of 'n'. n=13 => 1101 then there is 4 digits.
        return (n & (~(1<<(N-k))));
    }
